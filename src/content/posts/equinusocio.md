Remember the Material Theme for VS Code? It likely just shipped malware, and Mattia Astorino (aka equinusocio) is to blame.

If you're out of the loop, here's a quick summary: Mattia was a contributor to Material Theme. He kind of went insane. He started begging for money, and [closed sourced Material Theme in order to start selling a premium version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wz7YF2as-c). Oh - he also started threatening to sue anyone who re-used the colors or name "Material Theme".

Material Theme was previously Apache 2 licensed. He deleted the git history and work of many other contributors to hide this fact. I have been [maintaining a fork since he started threatening to sue people.](https://github.com/t3dotgg/vsc-material-but-i-wont-sue-you)

We are still awaiting more details on the malicious code he published. The VS Code team has [removed the extension and uninstalled it from all current users IDEs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43181591).

I will do my best to update this article as more info comes in. I just wanted to make sure that this was known publicly, and that Mattia Astorino (aka equinusocio) does not get to continue with his malicious actions.

Do not hire him. Do not sponsor him. Do not install anything he publishes. Mattia is a danger to all software, and he should be kept far away from the open source world.
